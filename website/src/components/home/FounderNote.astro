        <p>
          I built Agent to Bricks because I was tired of the same pattern: a new AI tool launches,
          charges $29/month, and does half of what a good CLI tool could do for free.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bricks Builder is one of the best page builders out there. It has a clean data model,
          real CSS control, and a component system that actually makes sense. It deserves AI tooling
          that matches its quality — without tacking on a recurring bill.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a passion project. It's free, it's open source, and it's growing. My hope is that
          Bricks eventually ships native AI tools that make all of this unnecessary. Until then, this
          is my contribution to the community.
