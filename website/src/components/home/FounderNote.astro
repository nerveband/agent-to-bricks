          I kept watching the same thing happen. A new AI tool for WordPress launches,
          looks good in the demo, then you see the pricing page. $29/month. $49/month.
          $99 for the "agency tier." On top of everything else you're already paying for.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bricks has a clean data model and real CSS control. I wanted AI tools that matched
          that quality. So I built a CLI that does it for free. You bring your own AI agent,
          use your own API keys, run it from your own machine.
        </p>

        <p>
          Honestly? I hope Bricks ships native AI tools that are better than this.
          When that happens, this project can quietly retire. Until then, it's here.
