        The AI tax on WordPress
      </h2>

        <p>
          AI tools for WordPress are multiplying. So are their price tags.
        </p>

        <p>
          Every new platform wants a monthly subscription on top of the hosting you already pay for,
          the page builder you already bought, and the design framework you already licensed. The costs stack up fast.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some tools offer lifetime deals, but you know how that goes. The deals pile up in your account,
          half of them stop getting updates, and plugin fatigue sets in.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bricks Builder is one of the best page builders available. It has a clean element system,
          solid global class management, and real CSS control. It deserves AI tooling that matches
          its quality — without another monthly bill attached.
        </p>

          Building sites with AI shouldn't cost a subscription on top of a subscription.
