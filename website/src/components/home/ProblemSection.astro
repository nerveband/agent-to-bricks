        The AI tax on WordPress

          There's no shortage of AI tools for WordPress. There's also no shortage of monthly invoices.
        </p>

        <p>
          $29/month here, $49/month there. On top of hosting. On top of Bricks. On top of ACSS.
          You're three subscriptions deep before you've written a single prompt.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some offer lifetime deals. You've bought a few. Half stopped shipping updates within a year.
          The other half pivoted to something you didn't sign up for.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bricks has a clean element system, real global class management, and honest-to-god CSS control.
          It earned better AI tooling than what's out there. So we built it.
